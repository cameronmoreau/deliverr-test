# Exercise Notes

## How to run
Run the type checker and units tests:
```
$ bin/test
```

**Note**: You may need to install `mypy` by running `pip3 install mypy`.
If you'd like to only run tests, run:
```
$ python3 src/test_inventory_allocator.py
```

## Comments & Notes
* [Python static types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) are used instead
of adding functionality to extensively validate input
